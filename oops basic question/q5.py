5. Write a Python program that creates a class called 'Shape' with a method to 
calculate the area. Create two subclasses, 'Circle' and 'Triangle', that inherit from 
the 'Shape' class and override the area calculation method. Create an instance of 
the 'Circle' class and calculate its area. Similarly, do the same for the 'Triangle' 
class.
